      Oh yeah! Oh my darlin' stand by me!
      No matter who your are, no matter where you go in life
      You gon' need somebody, to stand by you.
      No matter how much money you got, or the friends you got,
      You gon' need somebody, to stand by you

      How many roads must a man walk down
      Before you call him a man?
      How many seas must a white dove sail
      Before she sleeps in the sand?
      Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
      Before they're forever banned?
      The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
      The answer is blowin' in the wind
